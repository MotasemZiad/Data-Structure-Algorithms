# Data Structure and Algorithms
An implementation of Data Structure and Algorithms using **Java** programming language.

## Data Structure
What is exactly a Data Structure? <br>
Data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

### Types of Data Structure
- Linear Data Structure
- Non-linear Data Structure


#### Linear Data Structure
> In linear data structures, the elements are arranged in sequence one after the other. Since elements are arranged in particular order, they are easy to implement.

**Examples:**
1. Array
2. Stack
3. Queue 
4. Linked List


#### Non-linear Data Structure
> Unlike linear data structures, elements in non-linear data structures are not in any sequence. Instead they are arranged in a hierarchical manner where one element will be connected to one or more elements.

**Examples:**
1. Graph 
2. Tree

## Algorithms
What is exactly an Algorithm? <br>
An algorithm is a procedure used for solving a problem or performing a computation.

### Types of Algorithms
- Sorting Algorithms
- Searching Algorithms
- Graph Algorithms
- Gready Algorithms


#### Sorting Algorithms
> Bubble Sort, insertion sort, and many more. These algorithms are used to sort the data in a particular format.

#### Searching Algorithms
> Linear search, binary search, etc. These algorithms are used in finding a value or record that the user demands.

#### Graph Algorithms
>  It is used to find the solutions of problems like finding the shortest path between cities, real-life problems like traveling salesman problems.

#### Greedy Algorithm
> It is an approach for solving a problem by selecting the best option available at the moment.
